# Scenario description

The Titans are flattening the world. They are ignoring the other team, which means it's probably their fault. Destroy the enemy commander by any means necessary to save this planet

This scenario is best played on Normal. You will not have access to any metal producing buildings, so you'll have to get creative. Aircraft is disabled on all difficulties for all teams. Some of the old structures may remain unflattened in places the Titans can't reach.
 
Good luck.

 
This scenario is different based on the selected difficulty:
 
‣ Beginner: You can produce metal income buildings after all. The AI is meant to have no income, pending fix. Ragnarok disabled.
 
‣ Novice: You can produce metal income buildings after all. Regular AI difficulty. Ragnarok disabled.
 
‣ Normal: No metal income buildings. Regular AI difficulty. Ragnarok disabled. The intended difficulty. 
 
‣ Hard: No metal income buildings. Regular AI difficulty. Ragnarok enabled. The original difficulty.
 
‣ Brutal: No metal income buildings. The AI is a BARb. Ragnarok enabled. Probably impossible.
