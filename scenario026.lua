This scenario is different based on the selected difficulty:
 
‣ Beginner: You can produce metal income buildings after all. The AI will not build army units. Ragnarok disabled.
 
‣ Novice: You can produce metal income buildings after all. Regular AI difficulty. Ragnarok disabled.
 
‣ Normal: No metal income buildings. Regular AI difficulty. Ragnarok disabled. The intended difficulty. 
 
‣ Hard: No metal income buildings. Regular AI difficulty. Ragnarok enabled. The original difficulty.
 
‣ Brutal: No metal income buildings. The AI is a BARb. Ragnarok enabled. Probably impossible.
